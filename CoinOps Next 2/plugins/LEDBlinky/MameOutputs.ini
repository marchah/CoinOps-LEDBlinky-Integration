;For exclusive use with LEDBlinky – Arcade LED Control Software.
;Maps MAME Outputs to specific controls or LED Controller ports.
;
;The following MAME outputs are most useful when used in conjunction with lighting LEDs:
;LED0, LED1, LAMP0, LAMP1, LAMP2, ... LAMPn
;The purpose of each output varies from game to game, but LED0 and LED1 can generally be assumed to flash the player start buttons when credits are available.
;Use the MAMEOutputTest application to determine which outputs are generated by each game. The MAMEOutputTest app will also display which controls (if any) are associated with each output per this file.
;
;To define outputs for a specific game, create an output section
;with the section key equal to the ROM.
;For example, [digdug]
;
;The [default] outputs will be used for any game which does not
;have its own output section.
;
;Key=Value format:
;<MAMEOutput> = <ControlName>
;OR
;<MAMEOutput> = <LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,SingleIntensity>
;OR
;<MAMEOutput> = <LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,RedIntensity|LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,GreenIntensity|LEDControllerType,LEDControllerID,Port,BlueIntensity>
;
;LEDControllerType: LED Controller Name or Abbreviation. See the LEDBlinky Configuration Help Menu for a list of supported LED Controller names and abbreviations. Example: LEDWiz or LW, PACLED64 or PL, IPACUltimateIO or IP, PACDrive or PD, Howler or HO.
;LEDControllerID: This is the HardwareID value assigned to the LED Controller (LEDControllerType).
;Port: First Port = 1. Maximum Port varies based on the LED Controller (LEDControllerType).
;Intensity: 0-48, 129, 130, 131, 132 (values 129..132 only supported by LEDWiz)
;
;Each MAME output can be repeated to assign more than one LED and/or Control value.
;Spaces are allowed in the MAME Output (Key).
;
;sampleROM example. 
;LED0 is not used.
;LED1 is assigned to player 1, button 1 and player 1 button 9.
;LED1 is also assigned to an RGB on PacLED64 ID 1, ports 28/29/30 and lights white (48/48/48).
;LAMP1 is assigned to an RGB on LEDWiz ID1, ports 1/2/3 and lights Red (48/0/0).
;LAMP2 is assigned to a single LED on LEDWiz ID2, port 2.
